# Property Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting property prices using a machine learning model. It includes data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing of the data, training an ElasticNet model, and creating a Flask application for predicting property prices based on user input.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Describe how the data for this project was collected. Specify the data sources, data format, and any preprocessing steps applied during data collection.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provide an overview of the EDA process. Describe the steps taken to analyze the collected data, identify patterns, and gain insights into the property prices dataset.

- **Preprocessing**: Explain the preprocessing steps performed on the data. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, or any other data transformation steps.

- **Model Training**: Describe the process of training the ElasticNet model. Provide details about the model architecture, hyperparameters, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

- **Flask Application**: Explain how the Flask application works. Describe how users can interact with the application, input new property data, and obtain predicted property prices. Include any relevant instructions on how to run the Flask app locally.

## Dependencies

List the software dependencies required to run the project. Include the versions of Python and any additional packages/libraries used in the project. It's recommended to include a `requirements.txt` file that contains all the necessary dependencies and their versions. You can generate this file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## Installation and Usage

Provide instructions on how to install and use the project. Include steps to set up the development environment, install the required dependencies, and run the Flask application.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/shonshchori/PropertiesPricePrediction/
cd PropertiesPricePrediction
```


2. Set up the environment:

- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # for Unix/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # for Windows
```

- Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Flask application:

`python api.py`


4. Access the Flask application in your web browser:

`http://localhost:5000`
