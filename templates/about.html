  <h1>Property Price Prediction</h1>

  <p>
    This project focuses on predicting property prices using a machine learning model. It includes exploratory data analysis
    (EDA), preprocessing of the data, training an ElasticNet model, and creating a Flask application for predicting property
    prices based on user input.

                In this section, we performed an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the property prices dataset. The EDA
                process involved several steps:
                </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data exploration</strong>: We examined the structure and content of the dataset, including the number of rows
                      and columns, data types, and basic statistics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Missing data handling</strong>: We investigated the presence of missing values in the dataset and applied
                      appropriate techniques to handle them, such as imputation or removal, based on the nature and extent of missingness.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Outlier detection</strong>: We identified outliers in the data using statistical methods or visualization
                      techniques and decided on the appropriate treatment, which could involve removal or transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature engineering</strong>: We derived new features from the existing ones, such as creating boolean
                      indicators for Education or Shopping centers around the properties.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                      <strong>
                          The EDA process provided valuable insights into the dataset, enabling us to make informed decisions during the
                          preprocessing and modeling stages.

              <p>To prepare the data for modeling, we performed several preprocessing steps on the dataset. These steps included:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Encoding categorical variables</strong>: Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations
                  using techniques such as one-hot encoding. This transformation allowed the machine learning model to interpret these
                  variables effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature scaling</strong>: We applied feature scaling to ensure that all features were on a similar scale.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>
                  By performing these preprocessing steps, we prepared the dataset in a format suitable for training the ElasticNet
                  model.</strong></p>

                In this section, we describe the process of training the ElasticNet model on the preprocessed dataset. The ElasticNet
                model is a linear regression model that combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques. Here are the key details:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Model architecture</strong>: The ElasticNet model is a linear regression model that incorporates both the L1
                  (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms. It combines the strengths of both regularization techniques to achieve a
                  balance between feature selection and parameter shrinkage.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperparameters</strong>: The ElasticNet model has two main hyperparameters: alpha and l1_ratio. Alpha
                  controls the overall strength of regularization, where higher values result in stronger regularization. The l1_ratio
                  determines the mix between L1 and L2 regularization, ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to pure L2 regularization
                  and 1 corresponding to pure L1 regularization.</li>
                <li><strong>Training process</strong>: We split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets, typically using a
                  random or stratified sampling technique. We then fitted the ElasticNet model to the training data, optimizing the
                  hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation metrics</strong>: To assess the performance of the ElasticNet model, we used appropriate evaluation
                  metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics help quantify the model's
                  ability to predict property prices accurately.</li>
              </ol>
                <p><strong>
                    The training process allowed us to learn the optimal parameters for the ElasticNet model and evaluate its
                    performance on unseen data.

                The Flask application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the trained ElasticNet model and obtaining
                predicted property prices. Here's how it works:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>User interface</strong>: The Flask application presents a web-based user interface where users can input
                  property information, such as the number of rooms and the area size, address, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Data preprocessing</strong>: Once the user submits the property details, the Flask application preprocesses
                  the input data by applying the same transformations used during the initial data preprocessing step.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction</strong>: The preprocessed data is then passed to the trained ElasticNet model, which generates a
                  predicted property price based on the provided information.</li>
                <li><strong>Result display</strong>: The Flask application displays the predicted property price to the user, providing
                  valuable insights into the estimated value of the property.</li>
              </ol>
